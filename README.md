# The React Quiz Project

## Overview

The React Quiz Project is a simple quiz application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to take a 15-question quiz on React concepts.

## Features

- **Quiz Taking with Immediate Feedback:** Users can take quizzes and receive instant feedback on their performance.

- **Score Tracking and Progress Bar:** Quiz scores are recorded and displayed on a progress bar, providing a visual representation of the user's performance.

- **Highest Score Recording:** The system records the highest score achieved by the user.

- **Quiz Timer:** A timer is implemented during the quiz, ensuring a time-bound experience. The quiz automatically closes and finishes, preserving the current score when the timer runs out.

## Technologies

The React Quiz Project is built using the following technologies:

- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project utilizes React for creating dynamic and responsive quiz components.

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. TypeScript enhances code quality and helps catch potential errors during development.

- **JSON-Server:** A simple REST API server that allows you to mock a backend by serving data from a JSON file. In this project, JSON-Server is used to simulate interactions with a backend for quiz data.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling the application, providing a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
